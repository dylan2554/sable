# Sable

A UCI chess engine written from scratch in C++, with a **self-trained NNUE evaluation**.
Estimated strength: **~3200 CCRL (single-threaded, estimated)** — see [Strength](#strength).

Sable was built and trained on a single desktop PC (Intel i7-11700K + RTX 3070) — the
neural network's training data was generated entirely by the engine playing itself,
with no external datasets or pretrained weights.

## Features

**Board & move generation**
- Bitboard representation with magic-bitboard sliding-piece attacks
- Fully legal move generation (verified by perft against known node counts, including Kiwipete)
- Zobrist hashing

**Search**
- Iterative deepening with aspiration windows
- Principal Variation Search (PVS) inside alpha-beta
- Transposition table with depth-preferred replacement and aging
- Null-move pruning
- Late Move Reductions (history-adjusted)
- Singular extensions (with double extensions and multi-cut)
- Reverse futility pruning, futility pruning, razoring
- Late move pruning and history pruning
- SEE-based pruning of losing captures
- Killer moves, counter-moves, and butterfly + continuation history (with maluses)
- Quiescence search with SEE filtering, delta pruning, and quiet checks
- Mate-distance pruning
- **Lazy SMP** multithreading (1–16 threads)

**Evaluation**
- NNUE: `768 → 512×2 (perspective accumulators) → 1`, clipped-ReLU, quantized int16
- Incrementally updated accumulators, accelerated with AVX2 SIMD
- Falls back to a hand-crafted tapered evaluation (PeSTO + king safety, pawn structure,
  mobility) when no network file is present

**Training pipeline** (included)
- `sable datagen` — self-play data generation, writing labeled positions to disk
- `train_gpu.py` — PyTorch NNUE trainer (GPU or CPU)
- `train.py` — pure-NumPy trainer (no GPU required)
- The net was trained across several "generations": each generation regenerates data
  using the previous, stronger network to label positions, then retrains.

## Usage

Sable speaks the [UCI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface),
so it works in any UCI GUI (Arena, Cute Chess, BanksiaGUI, etc.).

1. Download `sable.exe` and `sable.nnue` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Keep **both files in the same folder** — the engine loads `sable.nnue` automatically.
3. In your GUI: add a new UCI engine and point it at `sable.exe`.

UCI options:
- `Hash` (MB) — transposition table size
- `Threads` — number of search threads
- `EvalFile` — path to an NNUE file (defaults to `sable.nnue`)

## Building from source

Requires a C++17 compiler.

```sh
# Linux / macOS
g++ -O3 -mavx2 -pthread sable.cpp -o sable

# Windows (MinGW-w64)
g++ -O3 -mavx2 -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -pthread sable.cpp -o sable.exe
```

A build without `-mavx2` also works (slower NNUE inference) for older CPUs.

## Strength

**Estimated ~3200 CCRL Blitz, single-threaded.**

This was measured by triangulating against engines with published CCRL Blitz ratings,
under fair conditions: **single thread for both sides, equal 128 MB hash, 2'+1" time
control** (CCRL Blitz), ponder off. The estimate is consistent across four independent
anchors.

| Opponent (CCRL Blitz) | Sable score | Games | Implied Sable Elo |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Inanis 1.6.0 (~3000)  | 70%         | 100   | ~3150 |
| Stash v27 (~3057)     | ~76%        | 180   | ~3260 |
| Stash v30 (~3166)     | ~54%        | 180   | ~3195 |
| Stash v32 (~3252)     | ~43%        | 180   | ~3200 |

The anchors agree within their error bars, centering on **~3200 CCRL single-threaded**.
With multiple threads (Lazy SMP) Sable is stronger still; these numbers are the
single-thread figure for comparability with CCRL's testing conditions.

> Note: this is a self-estimate, not an official CCRL listing. The method follows the
> community-standard approach of testing against Stash versions of known rating
> (see the [engine testing guide](https://dannyhammer.github.io/engine-testing-guide/)).

## Training your own network

See `train_gpu.py` (or `train.py`). The pipeline is:

1. Generate self-play data: `sable datagen <games> <nodes_per_move> <out.bin> <seed> <hashMB>`
2. Train: `python train_gpu.py --data "*.bin" --epochs 30 --lam 0.85`
3. The trainer exports `sable.nnue` after every epoch; drop it next to the engine.

## About this project

Sable was built as a collaboration between me (Dylan) and Anthropic's Claude. Claude
wrote the engine and training code; I directed the design, ran all training and testing
on my own hardware (i7-11700K + RTX 3070), debugged the pipeline, and verified strength
at every step. The neural network was trained from zero on self-play games generated on
my own PC — no external data and no pretrained weights.

I'm releasing it to show what one person and a current AI model can build together in a
few days: a chess engine going from non-existent to ~3200 CCRL (estimated) in under a week.
